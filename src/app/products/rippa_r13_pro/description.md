# The Rippa R13 PRO: The Goldilocks Solution—Not Too Big, Not Too Small

## Perfectly Sized for Maximum Productivity

Meet the **Rippa R13 Pro**—the excavator that contractors discover hits the sweet spot between compact access and serious capability. This 1.3-ton professional-grade machine delivers genuine excavation performance in a size that navigates residential properties, urban jobsites, and tight-access locations with confidence. When the ultra-compact R10 series feels too small but larger excavators can't access your worksite, the R13 Pro emerges as the perfect solution.

Powered by the legendary **Kubota D722 three-cylinder diesel engine** producing **10.5 kW (14 HP)**, the R13 Pro combines proven reliability with impressive digging force. The advanced **expandable track system** (29.5" - 39" width) provides unmatched versatility—narrow for access, wide for operational stability—making this excavator exceptionally adaptable to diverse jobsite conditions.

## Engineered for Professional Versatility

**Expandable Track System**  
The R13 Pro's signature feature—**hydraulically adjustable track width**—transforms this excavator from a narrow-access specialist to a stable powerhouse in seconds. Retract tracks to 29.5 inches for passage through gates and narrow openings, then expand to 39 inches for maximum stability during heavy digging operations. This intelligent engineering provides capabilities of two machines in one compact package.

**Swing Boom Innovation**  
The R13 Pro's **offset boom capability** enables digging parallel to walls, along foundations, and beside obstacles without constant machine repositioning. This feature dramatically improves productivity in trenching applications, foundation work, and operations where standard boom geometry limits efficiency. The swing boom alone justifies the R13 Pro investment for contractors focused on specialized applications.

**Impressive Working Envelope**  
With **7.5-foot maximum digging depth** and **12.5-foot horizontal reach**, the R13 Pro provides substantial capability for residential foundation excavation, utility trenching, pond construction, and commercial site preparation. The working dimensions approach larger 1.5-ton machines while maintaining superior access and lower operating costs.

## Kubota Power You Can Trust

**Proven D722 Diesel Engine**  
The Kubota D722 represents decades of engineering excellence in compact diesel power. This three-cylinder water-cooled engine delivers smooth, consistent performance throughout the RPM range while maintaining exceptional fuel economy. Contractors appreciate the D722's:

- **Legendary reliability** with hundreds of thousands of proven field hours
- **Excellent cold-weather starting** ensuring productive mornings year-round
- **Outstanding fuel efficiency** reducing hourly operating costs significantly
- **Low maintenance requirements** with straightforward service procedures
- **Readily available parts** through extensive Kubota dealer networks

**Advanced Hydraulic System**  
The R13 Pro's gear pump hydraulic system with **4-way hydraulic control** provides responsive, precise operation across all functions. Smooth boom movements, controlled bucket operation, and predictable machine response ensure operators work efficiently from the first hour of use.

## Built for All-Day Productivity

**Operator-Focused Design**  
The R13 Pro's ergonomically engineered operator station positions controls intuitively for comfort during extended operations. Proportional joystick controls provide smooth, precise hydraulic response, while strategic sight lines maintain clear visibility to the bucket edge and surrounding work area. When operators feel comfortable and confident, productivity soars.

**Dual-Speed Travel System**  
The R13 Pro's **two-speed travel motor** optimizes productivity—high speed for efficient repositioning between work areas, low speed for maximum tractive effort on slopes and challenging terrain. This intelligent system ensures the right speed for every situation without compromising power or efficiency.

**Professional-Grade Controls**  
Experienced operators appreciate the R13 Pro's predictable machine behavior and responsive controls. New operators value the intuitive layout and forgiving operation that enables productive work without extensive familiarization. This versatility makes the R13 Pro ideal for contractors with varying operator experience levels.

## Versatility Through Attachment Compatibility

The R13 Pro's hydraulic system powers a comprehensive range of professional attachments, transforming this compact excavator into a multi-purpose jobsite tool:

- **Hydraulic breakers** for demolition and concrete removal
- **Auger attachments** for post holes and foundation drilling
- **Hydraulic thumbs** for material sorting and handling
- **Trenching buckets** in various widths for utility installation
- **Grading buckets** for precision finish work and landscape contouring
- **Specialty attachments** for task-specific applications

This attachment ecosystem maximizes equipment utilization and return on investment by enabling one machine to handle multiple project phases.

## Ideal Applications and Markets

**Residential Contractors**  
General contractors trust the R13 Pro for foundation excavation, crawl space digging, utility installation, and site preparation where larger equipment risks property damage but ultra-compact machines lack adequate capacity.

**Landscaping Professionals**  
Landscape contractors depend on the R13 Pro for pond excavation, major grading projects, retaining wall installation, and hardscape construction where the expandable tracks provide access and stability in a single machine.

**Utility and Municipal Contractors**  
Public works departments and utility contractors choose the R13 Pro for water line installation, sewer lateral connections, storm drain construction, and infrastructure maintenance in residential areas requiring careful property management.

**Agricultural Applications**  
Farms and ranches utilize the R13 Pro for drainage improvements, barn construction support, livestock facility upgrades, and general property maintenance where compact size prevents pasture damage while delivering adequate excavation capability.

## Transport and Logistics Advantages

**Trailer-Friendly Weight**  
At approximately **2,580 pounds**, the R13 Pro trailers easily behind half-ton pickup trucks using standard equipment trailers. No CDL requirements, no special permits, no expensive transport coordination—just hook up and go. This logistics simplicity enables multi-site productivity and reduces non-billable transport costs.

**Compact Transport Dimensions**  
The R13 Pro's reasonable transport footprint fits in enclosed trailers, standard landscape trucks, and tight storage facilities. This compact profile simplifies fleet management and reduces facility requirements compared to larger excavators.

**Rapid Deployment Capability**  
Quick loading, efficient transport, and fast unloading enable the R13 Pro to serve multiple projects daily. This mobility advantage means one machine generates more revenue than equipment spending hours in non-productive transport.

## Low Operating Costs Drive Profitability

**Fuel Efficiency Excellence**  
The Kubota D722's exceptional fuel economy translates directly to competitive hourly operating costs. Contractors appreciate how the R13 Pro's efficiency enhances job profitability while maintaining the power necessary for productive excavation.

**Simplified Maintenance**  
Straightforward service access, grouped maintenance points, and extended service intervals ensure the R13 Pro spends maximum time generating revenue rather than consuming shop hours. Routine maintenance happens quickly, and the Kubota engine's proven durability minimizes unexpected repairs.

**Durable Professional Construction**  
Reinforced boom structure, heavy-duty undercarriage components, and quality hydraulic systems ensure the R13 Pro withstands daily professional use. This isn't light-duty equipment—it's engineered for contractors who depend on their machines every working day.

## The Goldilocks Investment

The Rippa R13 Pro occupies that perfect middle ground contractors seek—compact enough for residential access and efficient transport, yet powerful enough for genuine excavation work that generates revenue. The expandable tracks and swing boom capabilities provide versatility that larger, more expensive excavators can't match in confined environments.

When you analyze total cost of ownership—factoring in Kubota reliability, fuel efficiency, trailer-friendly logistics, and multi-site productivity—the R13 Pro delivers exceptional value for growing operations and established contractors alike.
