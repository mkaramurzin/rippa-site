# The Rippa R32 PRO: Heavy-Duty Performance Without Compromise

## When Serious Projects Demand Serious Equipment

Step up to the **Rippa R32 Pro** when your excavation demands exceed what smaller machines can deliver, but you still need the maneuverability and efficiency of compact equipment. This 3.2-ton powerhouse represents the pinnacle of mini excavator engineering—combining exceptional digging force, advanced hydraulic systems, and all-terrain capability in a surprisingly agile package that tackles the toughest jobs with confidence.

Built around the legendary **Kubota V1505 four-cylinder diesel engine** generating **25 HP (18.5 kW) of continuous power**, the R32 Pro delivers the muscle professionals need for demanding excavation, heavy-duty trenching, foundation work, and commercial site development. This isn't just a scaled-up mini excavator—it's a purpose-built workhorse engineered for contractors who refuse to compromise on performance.

## Engineered for Maximum Productivity

**Exceptional Digging Power**  
The R32 Pro's **cast swing boom and reinforced boom structure** deliver industry-leading digging force that powers through compacted soil, rocky terrain, and challenging ground conditions. With a maximum digging depth of **111.3 inches** and working reach extending to **190.2 inches**, this machine provides the working envelope of larger excavators while maintaining the maneuverability contractors demand.

**Advanced Load-Sensitive Hydraulics**  
The sophisticated **load-sensitive piston pump hydraulic system** automatically adjusts flow and pressure based on operational demands, delivering smooth, precise control while maximizing fuel efficiency. This intelligent system responds instantly to operator inputs, reducing cycle times and boosting productivity throughout the workday.

**Zero-Tail Swing Design**  
Despite its substantial power, the R32 Pro features **zero-tail swing engineering** that enables confident operation in restricted areas, along walls, and near obstacles without risk of the counterweight striking surroundings. This design philosophy delivers big-machine capability with small-machine access.

## Built for All-Day Comfort and Control

**Premium Operator Environment**  
Your operators deserve the best, and the R32 Pro delivers with a **spacious, climate-controlled cab** that sets new standards for mini excavator comfort. The ergonomically designed station features:

- **Air conditioning** for all-season comfort and productivity
- **LCD multifunction display** providing real-time machine diagnostics
- **Adjustable suspension seat** reducing fatigue during extended operations
- **Intuitive joystick controls** with proportional hydraulic response
- **Panoramic visibility** through large glass panels for superior sight lines

When operators are comfortable and confident, productivity soars—and the R32 Pro's premium cab environment ensures your team performs at their best hour after hour.

## All-Terrain Capability That Goes Anywhere

**Superior Ground Clearance**  
The R32 Pro's elevated track frame and optimized undercarriage design provide exceptional ground clearance, enabling confident operation across rough terrain, debris-filled sites, and uneven ground conditions. Where other compact excavators struggle, the R32 Pro excels.

**Robust Track System**  
Heavy-duty rubber tracks with **500mm (19.7") width** distribute the machine's weight efficiently, resulting in **minimal ground pressure of just 7.5 PSI**. This gentle footprint protects finished surfaces, enables operation on delicate terrain, and provides outstanding traction on slopes and soft ground.

**Dual-Speed Travel**  
Intelligent **two-speed travel system** (1.1 - 1.7 mph) optimizes productivity by enabling quick repositioning between work areas in high-speed mode, while low-speed provides maximum tractive effort and precise positioning for demanding applications.

## Versatility Through Attachment Compatibility

The R32 Pro's high-flow hydraulic system powers a comprehensive range of professional attachments, transforming this excavator into a true multi-purpose jobsite tool:

- **Hydraulic breakers** for demolition, rock breaking, and concrete removal
- **Auger drives** with various diameter bits for post holes and caisson drilling
- **Grapples and thumbs** for material sorting, debris handling, and land clearing
- **Trenching buckets** in multiple widths for utility installation
- **Grading buckets** for precision finish work and landscape contouring
- **Compaction wheels** for trench backfilling and site preparation

This attachment ecosystem means one R32 Pro replaces multiple specialized machines, dramatically improving equipment utilization and ROI.

## Proven Reliability Backed by Kubota Power

**Legendary Diesel Engine**  
The Kubota V1505 four-cylinder diesel engine represents decades of engineering excellence. This liquid-cooled powerplant is renowned for:

- **Exceptional fuel efficiency** reducing hourly operating costs
- **Proven durability** with hundreds of thousands of field-proven hours
- **All-weather reliability** starting consistently in extreme conditions
- **Low emissions** meeting strict environmental standards
- **Straightforward maintenance** with readily available parts and service

**Service-Friendly Engineering**  
Wide-opening engine access panels, color-coded service points, and grouped maintenance locations ensure routine service happens quickly and efficiently. Extended service intervals reduce downtime, while the robust construction minimizes unexpected repairs. The R32 Pro is built for contractors who measure success in productive hours, not shop time.

## Technical Performance That Delivers Results

**Power and Performance**  
The R32 Pro's Kubota V1505 engine produces 25 horsepower with substantial low-end torque, driving an advanced hydraulic system that delivers **21.1 GPM (80 LPM) of hydraulic flow**. This combination provides responsive control, impressive cycle times, and the power to maintain productivity in demanding applications.

**Working Envelope**  
With 111.3 inches of digging depth and 190.2 inches of maximum reach, the R32 Pro provides a substantial working envelope that minimizes machine repositioning. The 9.5 RPM swing speed enhances productivity in loading and trenching operations.

**Transport Dimensions**  
Despite its impressive capability, the R32 Pro maintains reasonable transport dimensions (17.8' L x 7.2' W x 10.5' H), allowing trailer transport behind standard pickup trucks in most jurisdictions without special permitting. The 7,055-pound operating weight strikes the perfect balance between capability and transportability.

**Extended Runtime**  
The generous **13.2-gallon (50-liter) fuel capacity** provides extended operating time between refueling, crucial for remote jobsites or maximizing billable hours without interruption.

## Who Trusts the R32 Pro?

**General Contractors** deploy the R32 Pro for commercial foundation excavation, utility installation, and site development where power and precision are equally critical.
