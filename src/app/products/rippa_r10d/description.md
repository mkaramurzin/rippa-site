# The Rippa R10D: Ultra-Compact Power for Precision Work

## Maximum Access, Minimal Footprint

When your projects demand excavation capability in spaces where larger equipment simply can't go, the **Rippa R10D** delivers the perfect solution. This ultra-compact 1-ton mini excavator combines genuine excavation performance with an incredibly narrow footprint, opening opportunities in residential backyards, gated communities, interior demolition, and urban renovation projects where access is everything.

At just **2,200 pounds** with an ultra-narrow profile as slim as **36 inches**, the R10D navigates through standard doorways, tight gates, and confined spaces that would challenge even larger compact excavators. Yet beneath this diminutive exterior lies the proven power of a **Kubota Z482 diesel engine** producing **8.2 kW (11 HP)** of reliable, fuel-efficient performance.

## Engineered for Access and Versatility

**Go Where Others Can't**  
The R10D's ultra-compact dimensions represent a game-changer for contractors tackling residential and urban projects. With its retractable track system (36" - 48"), this excavator squeezes through narrow passages, operates confidently alongside buildings, and accesses backyard jobsites without tearing up lawns or landscaping. When the job is in a tight spot, the R10D is your solution.

**Zero-Tail Swing Precision**  
The R10D's **zero-tail swing design** eliminates concerns about the counterweight striking walls, fences, or nearby vehicles. Work confidently along foundations, in narrow trenches, and beside obstacles—the entire machine rotates within its track width, providing maximum operational freedom in restricted environments.

**Impressive Working Envelope**  
Don't underestimate this compact machine. The R10D delivers a **6-foot digging depth** and **10.6-foot maximum reach**—substantial capability for residential foundation work, utility installation, pool excavation, and landscape renovation. The 9.9-foot digging height enables effective loading into trucks and dumping into elevated hoppers.

## Kubota Reliability in a Compact Package

**Proven Diesel Performance**  
The legendary **Kubota Z482 water-cooled diesel engine** brings decades of engineering excellence to this compact platform. This three-cylinder powerplant delivers smooth, consistent power throughout the RPM range while maintaining excellent fuel economy—crucial for contractors tracking job costs.

**Extended Runtime**  
Efficient diesel operation means longer working periods between refueling, maximizing productivity on remote jobsites or properties where fuel access is limited. The R10D's excellent fuel efficiency directly translates to lower hourly operating costs.

**All-Weather Reliability**  
Water-cooled operation ensures consistent performance in varying ambient temperatures, while Kubota's legendary cold-weather starting capability means reliable operation from early spring through late fall across diverse climates.

## Built for Daily Professional Use

**Operator-Focused Design**  
The R10D's ergonomic operator station positions controls intuitively for all-day comfort and precision. Responsive joystick controls provide proportional hydraulic flow, enabling smooth digging, precise grading, and accurate material placement. Even in an ultra-compact package, operator comfort and control remain priorities.

**Excellent Visibility**  
Strategic sight lines throughout the operator station provide clear visibility to the bucket edge, blade, and surrounding work area. This enhanced awareness improves accuracy, reduces cycle times, and boosts operator confidence in congested environments.

**Intuitive Operation**  
New operators appreciate the R10D's straightforward control layout and predictable machine response. Experienced operators value the precise hydraulic control and nimble maneuverability that enables maximum productivity in challenging spaces.

## Versatility Through Smart Engineering

**Adjustable Track Width**  
The R10D's retractable track system (36" - 48") provides unmatched versatility—retract to minimum width for passage through narrow openings, then extend for maximum stability during operation. This intelligent design feature dramatically expands the range of accessible jobsites.

**Integrated Blade System**  
The front-mounted bulldozer blade (36" - 48" width adjustable) serves multiple roles: provides additional stability during digging operations, enables efficient grading and backfilling, and facilitates smooth transport between work areas. This integrated blade means one less attachment to purchase and maintain.

**Attachment Compatibility**  
Despite its compact size, the R10D accommodates various professional attachments including narrower trenching buckets, grading buckets, hydraulic thumbs, and specialized tools. This versatility transforms the R10D into a true multi-purpose machine.

## Ideal Applications and Markets

**Residential Landscaping**  
Landscape contractors trust the R10D for backyard pond excavation, drainage installation, retaining wall construction, and major planting projects where lawn protection and tight access are essential.

**Property Maintenance**  
Facilities teams and property managers rely on the R10D for drainage improvements, sidewalk removal, fence post installation, and site improvements in established properties where larger equipment risks damage.

**Utility Contractors**  
Municipal crews and utility contractors choose the R10D for residential water line repairs, lateral sewer connections, gas line installation, and communication cable trenching where minimizing property disruption is paramount.

**General Contractors**  
Builders deploy the R10D for residential foundation digging, crawl space excavation, interior demolition support, and site preparation on infill lots where access constraints challenge traditional equipment.

**Agricultural Applications**  
Farm and ranch operations utilize the R10D for post hole augering, drainage improvements, barn renovations, and property maintenance where compact equipment prevents pasture damage.

## Transport and Logistics Made Simple

**Easy Trailer Loading**  
At just 2,200 pounds, the R10D loads safely onto standard equipment trailers towed by half-ton pickup trucks. No special permitting, no CDL requirements, no expensive transport logistics—just hook up and go.

**Compact Transport Dimensions**  
Transport dimensions of just 8 feet long by 3 feet wide by 7.2 feet high mean the R10D fits in enclosed trailers, standard landscape trucks, and tight storage areas. This compact profile simplifies fleet logistics and reduces storage costs.

**Quick Mobilization**  
Load, transport, and unload the R10D quickly, enabling multi-site productivity within a single day. This mobility advantage means one machine serves multiple projects efficiently.

## Low Operating Costs Drive Profitability

**Fuel Efficiency**  
The Kubota diesel engine's excellent fuel economy keeps hourly operating costs predictable and competitive. Contractors appreciate how the R10D's efficiency directly enhances job profitability.

**Minimal Maintenance**  
Straightforward service access, extended maintenance intervals, and readily available Kubota parts mean the R10D spends maximum time generating revenue rather than sitting in the shop.

**Durable Construction**  
Heavy-duty undercarriage components, reinforced boom structure, and quality hydraulic components ensure the R10D withstands daily professional use. This isn't a homeowner-grade machine—it's engineered for contractors who depend on their equipment.

## Technical Capabilities That Deliver

**Working Specifications**  
The R10D provides 6-foot digging depth, 10.6-foot horizontal reach, and 9.9-foot digging height—a comprehensive working envelope for an ultra-compact machine. The 7.4-foot dumping height accommodates standard truck loading operations.

**Mobility and Traction**  
Travel speed up to 0.93 mph enables efficient repositioning around jobsites, while 30% gradeability tackles slopes and uneven terrain confidently. Rubber tracks provide excellent traction while protecting finished surfaces.

**Ground Pressure**  
Low ground pressure (25.53 kPa) distributes machine weight effectively, protecting lawns, finished landscaping, and delicate surfaces—crucial for residential and commercial property work.

## Investment Value for Growing Operations
