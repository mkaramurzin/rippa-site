# The Rippa R10G: Gas-Powered Versatility for Indoor and Outdoor Work

## Clean Operation Wherever Your Projects Take You

Introducing the **Rippa R10G**—the gas-powered alternative that opens opportunities conventional diesel excavators can't access. When your projects demand zero-emissions operation for indoor demolition, enclosed spaces, or environmentally sensitive areas, the R10G delivers genuine excavation capability without diesel exhaust concerns. This unique 1-ton mini excavator combines the compact access of the R10 platform with the clean-burning performance of a professional-grade gasoline engine.

The R10G's **Briggs & Stratton Vanguard gasoline engine** producing **7.5 kW (10 HP)** provides reliable power while meeting strict emissions standards for indoor use. Whether you're working inside commercial buildings, residential basements, or climate-controlled facilities, the R10G operates cleanly and efficiently without compromising performance.

## The Indoor/Outdoor Advantage

**Zero-Emission Indoor Operation**  
The R10G's gasoline powerplant enables confident operation in spaces where diesel excavators are prohibited or impractical. Interior demolition, basement excavations, shopping mall renovations, and institutional facility upgrades—the R10G accesses these lucrative markets without emissions concerns. This capability alone opens revenue streams competitors with diesel-only fleets can't pursue.

**Flexible Fuel Availability**  
Gasoline's universal availability eliminates concerns about diesel delivery to remote jobsites. Fill up at any gas station, keep standard fuel cans on hand, and maintain operations anywhere without specialized fuel logistics. This convenience advantage reduces downtime and simplifies fleet management for contractors serving diverse markets.

**Quiet Operation**  
Gas engines typically operate more quietly than comparable diesels, reducing noise complaints in residential areas, noise-sensitive facilities, and urban environments where sound restrictions apply. The R10G enables work during extended hours without disturbing neighbors or facility occupants.

## Compact Access Meets Clean Power

**Ultra-Compact Footprint**  
Like its diesel counterpart, the R10G maintains the ultra-narrow profile that accesses residential backyards, tight gates, and confined spaces. At just **36 inches minimum width** with retractable tracks expanding to **48 inches**, this excavator squeezes through standard doorways and operates effectively in spaces larger equipment can't reach.

**Zero-Tail Swing Precision**  
The R10G's zero-tail swing design eliminates counterweight swing concerns, enabling confident operation along walls, beside vehicles, and in congested areas. Work efficiently in narrow trenches and restricted environments without constant repositioning or swing clearance worries.

**Impressive Working Envelope**  
Despite its compact dimensions, the R10G delivers **6-foot digging depth** and **10.6-foot horizontal reach**—substantial capability for residential foundation work, utility installation, interior excavation, and landscape projects. The working envelope rivals larger machines while maintaining superior access.

## Ideal for Specialized Applications

**Rental Fleet Essential**  
Rental companies recognize the R10G as a fleet must-have—the machine that enables indoor projects diesel excavators can't tackle. This unique capability commands premium rental rates and attracts customers requiring clean-operation equipment. The R10G's gasoline engine also simplifies maintenance for rental operations compared to diesel DEF systems and particulate filters.

**Facility Maintenance Teams**  
Property managers and facility maintenance operations value the R10G for interior work, parking structure repairs, loading dock modifications, and building system installations where diesel operation isn't feasible. One machine handles both interior and exterior projects seamlessly.

**Residential Contractors**  
Builders and remodeling contractors use the R10G for basement excavations, interior demolition support, foundation repairs, and crawl space modifications. The clean operation prevents contaminating living spaces while providing genuine excavation capability.

**Environmental Contractors**  
Projects in wetlands, conservation areas, or environmentally sensitive zones often mandate clean-burning equipment. The R10G meets these requirements while maintaining productivity in challenging locations.

## Proven Reliability and Simple Operation

**Professional-Grade Gasoline Power**  
The Briggs & Stratton Vanguard engine represents decades of engineering excellence in air-cooled gasoline powerplants. This commercial-grade engine delivers:

- **Consistent performance** across varying ambient temperatures
- **Easy starting** in all weather conditions with reliable ignition
- **Straightforward maintenance** with standard gasoline engine service
- **Readily available parts** through extensive dealer networks
- **Proven durability** in professional equipment applications

**User-Friendly Operation**  
Operators familiar with any compact excavator adapt instantly to the R10G. Intuitive joystick controls, proportional hydraulic response, and predictable machine behavior ensure productive operation from day one. The gasoline engine's simple operation eliminates diesel-specific concerns about glow plugs, DEF fluid, or cold-weather starting procedures.

**Simplified Maintenance**  
Gas engine maintenance follows familiar procedures—oil changes, air filter service, and spark plug replacement. No diesel particulate filters, no DEF systems, no injector concerns. This simplicity reduces maintenance costs and minimizes specialized service requirements.

## Transport and Logistics Made Easy

**Lightweight Mobility**  
At approximately **2,200 pounds**, the R10G trailers easily behind half-ton trucks using standard equipment trailers. Move between jobsites efficiently, serve multiple projects daily, and eliminate expensive transport logistics. The compact dimensions fit in enclosed trailers for secure storage and all-weather transport.

**Quick Deployment**  
Load, transport, and deploy the R10G rapidly for multi-site productivity. The lightweight design and compact footprint enable efficient mobilization that maximizes billable hours and minimizes non-productive time.

## Versatility Through Smart Engineering

**Retractable Track System**  
The R10G's adjustable track width (36" - 48") provides unmatched versatility—narrow for passage through tight openings, extended for operational stability. This feature dramatically expands accessible jobsite opportunities.

**Integrated Blade**  
The front-mounted bulldozer blade (36" - 48" adjustable) provides stability during digging, enables efficient backfilling and grading, and facilitates smooth transport around jobsites. This integrated system eliminates additional attachment purchases.

**Attachment Compatibility**  
Despite its compact size, the R10G accommodates various professional attachments including specialized buckets, hydraulic thumbs, and task-specific tools. Versatility transforms the R10G into a multi-purpose solution.

## Strategic Market Advantages

**Access Premium Markets**  
The R10G opens access to indoor demolition, commercial renovations, institutional facilities, and specialized applications that diesel-only fleets can't serve. This unique capability often commands premium pricing and reduces competition.

**Expand Service Offerings**  
Contractors with R10G capabilities can bid confidently on projects requiring indoor excavation or zero-emission operation. This expanded service range attracts customers seeking single-source solutions and increases market share.

**Regulatory Compliance**  
Many municipalities, institutions, and commercial facilities mandate or prefer low-emission equipment for indoor or sensitive-area operations. The R10G meets these requirements while maintaining productivity.

## Investment Value for Growing Fleets

The Rippa R10G occupies a unique market position—delivering clean-operation capability that opens specialized markets while maintaining the compact access and versatility of the R10 platform. For contractors, rental operations, and facility maintenance teams seeking competitive advantages, the R10G represents a strategic investment that generates returns through market access rather than just operational efficiency.
