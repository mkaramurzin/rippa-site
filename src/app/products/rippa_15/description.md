## The Perfect Balance of Power, Portability, and Performance

When your projects demand more than a micro excavator can deliver but you still need the agility to work in confined spaces, the **Rippa R15** stands ready as your ideal 1.5-ton solution. This mid-range workhorse combines serious excavation capability with the compact footprint contractors need for residential, commercial, and landscaping applications.

Built around a proven **Kubota D722 three-cylinder water-cooled diesel engine** delivering up to **12.8 kW of reliable power**, the R15 tackles demanding excavation tasks with consistent performance from dawn to dusk. Whether you're trenching utility lines, excavating foundations, or reshaping terrain, this machine provides the muscle you need without sacrificing fuel economy.

## Built for Real-World Job Sites

**Unmatched Versatility in Tight Spaces**  
With a compact body width of just **1.2 meters**, the R15 navigates narrow courtyards, backyard projects, gated communities, and urban construction sites where larger equipment simply can't reach. The foldable bulldozer blade ingeniously reduces transport width even further, making loading and highway transport effortless while giving you exceptional grading control on-site.

**Extended Reach Where It Counts**  
Don't let the compact size fool you—this excavator extends your productivity with an impressive **4.2-meter maximum reach** and **2.5-meter digging depth**. From pipeline installation to pond excavation, the R15 delivers the working envelope professionals demand without requiring a larger, costlier machine.

**Dual-Speed Travel for Enhanced Productivity**  
The R15's intelligent **high and low-speed travel modes** adapt instantly to your terrain and task requirements. Navigate quickly between work areas in high-speed mode, then switch to low-speed for precision positioning and maximum traction on slopes or challenging ground conditions.

## Operator Comfort Means All-Day Productivity

Your operators will appreciate the **thoughtfully designed operator station** that reduces fatigue and boosts output. The reinforced safety cab option provides comprehensive protection from the elements while maintaining excellent visibility to the work area. Climate control, intuitive controls, and minimal vibration mean your team stays focused and productive throughout long shifts.

## One Machine, Endless Possibilities

The R15's **quick-attach system supports over 20 professional-grade attachments**, transforming this excavator into a true multi-purpose tool:

- **Hydraulic breakers** for demolition and rock breaking
- **Auger attachments** for post holes and foundation drilling  
- **Wood grabbers and grapples** for land clearing and material handling
- **Trenching buckets** in multiple widths for utility installation
- **Grading buckets** for precision finish work

This attachment versatility means one R15 replaces multiple specialized machines, maximizing your equipment ROI and minimizing your capital investment.

## Engineered for Reliability and Low Operating Costs

**Proven Diesel Power**  
The Kubota diesel engine isn't just powerful—it's legendary for reliability and longevity. This water-cooled three-cylinder powerplant runs smoothly, starts reliably in all conditions, and delivers **optimized fuel economy** that keeps your operating costs predictable and low.

**Service-Friendly Design**

Heavy-duty undercarriage components, reinforced boom structure, and quality hydraulic components ensure the R15 withstands the rigors of professional use year after year. This isn't a light-duty machine—it's built for contractors who depend on their equipment every single day.

## Technical Specifications That Matter

**Engine & Power**  
The R15 harnesses a Kubota D722 three-cylinder water-cooled diesel engine producing 12.8 kW of maximum output. This proven powerplant delivers consistent hydraulic flow for responsive controls and impressive digging force, while maintaining excellent fuel efficiency that keeps your hourly operating costs competitive.

**Working Dimensions**  
With a maximum digging depth of 2.5 meters and a working reach extending to 4.2 meters, the R15 provides a substantial work envelope for a compact machine.
